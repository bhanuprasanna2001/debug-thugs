## What It Does
Pathly is a smart, LLM-powered learning assistant built for students enrolled in intensive bootcamps. It collects daily feedback on what skills learners enjoyed or struggled with, then processes this data using AI to:

- Summarize learning journeys
- Identify personal strengths and challenges
- Suggest growth areas and tech stacks
- Recommend courses
- Match potential career paths and jobs


---

## Problem Statement
- Bootcamp students are overloaded with daily content and tasks.
- They struggle to understand what theyâ€™re mastering versus what theyâ€™re missing.
- Thereâ€™s no structured way to reflect, track skills, or connect daily progress to career readiness.
- Most learners finish with unclear strengths and no guided path forward.

---

## Our Solution
Pathly collects daily reflections from learners over a 50-day course. Each entry includes:
- Liked & disliked skills selected by the user
- Reasons for their preferences (entered as comments)
- Confidence levels and tool ratings via extra feedback questions

Daily entries are stored in MongoDB, and each dayâ€™s submission also updates the learnerâ€™s progress.

On Day 50:
- GPT-4 reads the entire reflection history and produces a personalized summary
- The summary includes: key strengths, areas of struggle, and learning style patterns
- This summary is passed to a RAG-powered recommender that uses FAISS to search a curated corpus of technical courses
- Based on retrieved content, the system suggests ideal next courses and growth paths

The platform also includes:
- A Resume Uploader that will extract core skills and maps the learnerâ€™s skills suggest the role one must be applying to.

Together, Pathly not only summarizes learning but actively suggests what to learn next and where to grow.
