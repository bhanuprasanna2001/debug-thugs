Notes:

Challenges while learning and managing and intensive learning journey:
1. Managing intensive daily workloads.
2. connecting prior skills to new learnings.
3. planning their future career paths.

Develop an AI driven career copilot that supports them right from the beginning of their journey of learning.

1. for 1: Create tools that help students to track their progress and manage large amount of new information easily.
2. for 2: Develop systems that provide personalized guidance for building technical proficiency.
3. for 3: Design solutions that bride the gap between bootcamp completion and employment.

Ideas:
1. Get data about their progress everyday, like what did they like today that actually they felt good learning?


Tech stack:
- Python, LLM, AI Search/ Semantic search capabilities, Frontend, Backend Frameworks (any python framework recommended)
- Use RAG or any good framework to better understand the data.
- Use Angular for better score.
- AI Search to use any algorithm 

Deliverables:
- Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
- Presentation
- Technical Documentation (GitBook)

Things on mind:
1. Need to figure out what features to implement to have the best possible MVP.
2. Need to also have a Technical Documentation using (GitBook).
3. Create a best presentation. Also create a Video showcasing the MVP.

As entrepreneurial approach as possible and full technical is the main thing.
