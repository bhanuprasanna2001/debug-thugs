### Phases

1. During course:
	1. The content is structured in day wise content as it is a bootcamp. Every day new content is released. Every content also has the skills that will be gained in that day.
	2. If the user completes the entire day's content, then he is shown a form where he is asked what skills he enjoyed working on. It will be a multiple choice - For example, Python, Data Analysis, Visualizations, and Data Cleaning. Out of these user might select a few options. Suppose he chooses Python and Data Analysis.
	3. After taking input of the multiple choice we then post the user the following questions:
		1. Why did he like working on Python and Data Analysis skills?
		2. Why did he not like working on Data Cleaning and Visualization?
	4. This data is stored in a database building a knowledge base which we later use during the After course career path planning and other analysis.
2. After Course:
	1. We have the data for each day and the user feedback on what he liked and what he didn't like.
	2. Based on this data we actually help the user to look at the possible career paths based on their feedback.
	3. We could also provide what more courses that the user can do in order to have more access to more career paths.
	4. Basic analytics, Total time spent on this course, etc.



### Notes:

Challenges while learning and managing and intensive learning journey:
1. Managing intensive daily workloads.
2. connecting prior skills to new learnings.
3. planning their future career paths.

Develop an AI driven career copilot that supports them right from the beginning of their journey of learning.

1. for 1: Create tools that help students to track their progress and manage large amount of new information easily.
2. for 2: Develop systems that provide personalized guidance for building technical proficiency.
3. for 3: Design solutions that bride the gap between bootcamp completion and employment.

Ideas:
1. Get data about their progress everyday, like what did they like today that actually they felt good learning?


Tech stack:
- Python, LLM, AI Search/ Semantic search capabilities, Frontend, Backend Frameworks (any python framework recommended)
- Use RAG or any good framework to better understand the data.
- Use Angular for better score.
- AI Search to use any algorithm 

Deliverables:
- Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
- Presentation
- Technical Documentation (GitBook)

Things on mind:
1. Need to figure out what features to implement to have the best possible MVP.
2. Need to also have a Technical Documentation using (GitBook).
3. Create a best presentation. Also create a Video showcasing the MVP.

As entrepreneurial approach as possible and full technical is the main thing.
